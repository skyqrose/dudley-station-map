# List of Station Maps

Though I didn't know of any maps of Dudley Station at the start of this project, I've since found a few. They're all here, along with other MBTA station maps I've found, and a few from outside MBTA.

If you find more maps, please send them to me.

## Maps of Dudley Station

* This map is posted at Dudley Station, but it's, uh, not great, and also doesn't exist online.

* A map made by Nathaniel Fruchter, in response to seeing my first version. I adapted a number of ideas from it into my second version.

* By Andrew Stokols, 2015, as part of a [student project reimagining Dudley Square as a neighborhood Hub](https://www.andrewstokols.com/dudley-square-transit-hub-to-neighborhood-hub/). It's made for urban planning, not navigation.
