Dudley Station connects 17 different bus lines, managing 16,000 boardings per weekday ([source](https://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Portals/49/Docs/Focus40BusReport.pdf)). But finding your stop is difficult over almost two acres of platforms. I couldn't find any existing maps of the station, so I made one.

I'm collecting a list of maps of Dudley Station [here](other_maps), as well as other station maps, for inspiration. You can find the first version of my map there, as well as the response by [Nathaniel Fruchter](https://github.com/nhfruchter/dudley-map) that inspired many of the updates for v2. If you know of more, please send them to me.
